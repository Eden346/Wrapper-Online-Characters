# GoAnimate-Character-Dump
This repository contains a dump of XML snippets created by the legacy GoAnimate character creator, including the source code used to extract them.  These dump files, located in the `characters` directory, are grouped into granules of 1,000.  They are purposed to be accessed by a service I'm simultaneously working on: [GoAnimate-Wrapper](https://github.com/Windows81/goAnimate-Wrapper).

# wrapper online
all the characters too wrapper online. I had too move them too another repo because them not working (probably because my github pro account expired)
